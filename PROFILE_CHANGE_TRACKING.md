# Profile Change Tracking System

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the profile change tracking system that enhances the customer activity timeline with specific profile update information.

## Features

- Tracks specific profile field changes (email, phone, name, avatar, address, bio)
- Stores change history with old and new values
- Displays detailed activity information in the customer timeline
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing profile update activities

## Implementation Details

### Backend Models

1. **ProfileChangeHistory** - Tracks individual profile changes
   - `field_changed`: The specific field that was modified
   - `old_value`: Previous value before the change
   - `new_value`: New value after the change
   - `change_description`: Human-readable description of the change

### Backend Logic

1. **Profile Update Tracking** - When a user updates their profile, the system:
   - Captures old values before the update
   - Compares with new values after the update
   - Creates ProfileChangeHistory records for each changed field
   - Stores meaningful descriptions of the changes

2. **Activity Timeline Enhancement** - The activity timeline endpoint now:
   - Queries ProfileChangeHistory records for the last 30 days
   - Creates specific timeline entries for each profile change
   - Maintains the generic "Updated Profile" entry as a fallback
   - Shows up to 10 recent profile changes in the timeline

### Frontend Integration

1. **Activity Timeline Page** - Updated to display:
   - Specific profile change activities with field information
   - Detailed descriptions of what was changed
   - Proper categorization of profile updates

## API Endpoints

### Profile Update

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /auth/users/update_profile/`
- **Function**: Updates user profile and tracks specific changes
- **Tracking**: Automatically creates ProfileChangeHistory records

### Activity Timeline

- **Endpoint**: `GET /auth/users/activity_timeline/`
- **Function**: Returns customer activity timeline with enhanced profile changes
- **Response**: Includes specific profile change entries with metadata

## Usage Examples

### Example Activity Timeline Entry

```json
{
  "id": "profile_change_123",
  "type": "profile",
  "title": "Profile Update - Email Address",
  "description": "Email updated from old@example.com to new@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T16:06:28.122395Z",
  "status": "completed",
  "icon": "user",
  "metadata": {
    "field_changed": "email",
    "old_value": "old@example.com",
    "new_value": "new@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can see exactly what profile information was changed and when
2. **Better Audit Trail**: Provides a detailed history of profile modifications
3. **Improved Transparency**: Makes profile update activities more informative
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing functionality while adding new features

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed AttributeError when accessing profile_picture attribute
- Corrected profile tracking logic to properly access user attributes
- Improved duplicate detection logic for profile changes

## Troubleshooting

If you're only seeing one recent profile change instead of multiple changes:

1. Check that profile changes are within the last 30 days
2. Verify that the frontend is properly displaying all timeline items
3. Ensure that the profile update endpoint is correctly tracking changes

## Future Enhancements

1. Add tracking for password changes
2. Include IP address and device information for security auditing
3. Add user notifications for significant profile changes
4. Implement change rollback functionality
