## Archive Status

- **Status:** ARCHIVED
- **Date Archived:** October 2025
- **Reason:** Multiple voucher documents consolidated into single comprehensive documentation
- **Superseded By:** [Voucher System Documentation](../../features/voucher-system/README.md)

## Consolidation Notes

These documents were part of the original voucher system development but contained:

1. **Redundant Information** - Multiple documents covering the same implementation
2. **Inconsistent Naming** - Mixed naming conventions and organization
3. **Outdated Content** - Information superseded by current implementation
4. **Scattered Details** - Related information spread across multiple files

The new consolidated documentation provides a single source of truth with:

- ✅ Current implementation status and details
- ✅ Consistent organization and naming
- ✅ Comprehensive API and usage documentation  
- ✅ Clear integration with rewards system

## File Naming Convention

All files follow the pattern: `[TYPE]_VOUCHER_SYSTEM_[DESCRIPTION].md`

- `IMPLEMENTATION_` - Implementation completion reports
- `FEATURE_` - Specification documents  
- `PHASE_` - Future planning and roadmap documents
