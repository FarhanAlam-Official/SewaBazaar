# Voucher System Documentation

## Overview

The SewaBazaar voucher system is a simplified fixed-value voucher implementation that eliminates partial usage complexity. The system follows a "user's choice" approach where vouchers can be applied to any booking amount, with any unused value being the user's decision.

## Current System Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Implementation Status

- ✅ **Backend System**: Complete with Django models, API endpoints, and admin interface
- ✅ **Frontend System**: Complete with React components and dashboard integration
- ✅ **QR Code Integration**: Generate and scan QR codes for easy redemption
- ✅ **Mobile Interface**: Responsive design for all device sizes

## System Architecture

### Database Models

- **RewardVoucher**: Core voucher model with fixed-value usage policy
- **RewardAccount**: User points balances and tier management
- **PointsTransaction**: Complete audit trail of all points activity

### Key Features

- Fixed-value vouchers (Rs. 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000)
- No minimum booking requirements
- QR code generation for each voucher
- Tier system integration (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond)
- Admin management with bulk operations

## Voucher Usage Policy

### Simplified Rules

```bash
Rule: Voucher can be used on ANY booking amount > 0
- Rs. 500 voucher + Rs. 300 booking → Rs. 300 discount, Rs. 200 wasted (user's choice)
- Rs. 500 voucher + Rs. 700 booking → Rs. 500 discount, pay Rs. 200
- No minimum booking requirements
- User decides if they want to "waste" voucher value
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
✅ All Cases Are Valid:
- Rs. 100 voucher + Rs. 50 booking → Pay Rs. 0, Rs. 50 voucher value wasted
- Rs. 100 voucher + Rs. 150 booking → Pay Rs. 50, full voucher value used
- Rs. 500 voucher + Rs. 500 booking → Pay Rs. 0, full voucher value used
```
