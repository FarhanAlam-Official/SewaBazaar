## Getting Started

1. Review the [Implementation Plan](file://d:\Semester%20Final%20Project\6th%20Sem%20Final%20Project\SewaBazaar\docs\proposed_plans\SUPPORT_TICKET_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for overall approach
2. Study the [API Contract](file://d:\Semester%20Final%20Project\6th%20Sem%20Final%20Project\SewaBazaar\docs\proposed_plans\SUPPORT_TICKET_SYSTEM_API_CONTRACT.md) for endpoint details
3. Examine the [Database Schema](file://d:\Semester%20Final%20Project\6th%20Sem%20Final%20Project\SewaBazaar\docs\proposed_plans\SUPPORT_TICKET_SYSTEM_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) for model relationships
4. Use [Issue Templates](file://d:\Semester%20Final%20Project\6th%20Sem%20Final%20Project\SewaBazaar\docs\proposed_plans\SUPPORT_TICKET_SYSTEM_ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md) to create GitHub tickets
5. Follow the [Frontend Checklist](file://d:\Semester%20Final%20Project\6th%20Sem%20Final%20Project\SewaBazaar\docs\proposed_plans\SUPPORT_TICKET_SYSTEM_FRONTEND_CHECKLIST.md) for UI implementation
