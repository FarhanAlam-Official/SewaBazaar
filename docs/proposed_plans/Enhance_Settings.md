# Enhance Customer Settings Page Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the customer settings page in the SewaBazaar platform. The current implementation provides a solid foundation but requires improvements in security, user experience, and accessibility to meet production standards.

## Current State Analysis

### Implemented Features

1. **Profile Settings** - Fully functional with form validation and API integration
2. **Preferences** - Theme, language, and timezone settings with API integration
3. **Notification Settings** - Email/push toggles and topic subscriptions
4. **Security Settings** - Partially implemented (change password, 2FA, sessions)

### Identified Gaps

1. **Backend Security** - Demo implementations for 2FA and session management
2. **Account Management** - Missing data export and account deletion endpoints
3. **Frontend UX** - Limited image handling, basic form validation
4. **Accessibility** - Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation enhancements

- Include confirmation mechanisms for destructive actions

**Backend Changes**:

- Create data export endpoint:
  - Generate user data package asynchronously
  - Provide download link upon completion
  - Implement proper data sanitization
- Create account deletion endpoint:
  - Require password confirmation
  - Implement 2FA verification if enabled
  - Soft delete user data with option for permanent deletion
  - Notify user of consequences

### Phase 2: Frontend UX Improvements (High Priority)

#### 2.1 Profile Picture Enhancements

**Objective**: Improve profile picture upload experience

**Technical Requirements**:

- Implement image cropping functionality using `react-easy-crop`
- Add drag-and-drop file upload support
- Implement client-side image compression
- Add file type and size validation

**Frontend Changes**:

- Install and integrate `react-easy-crop` library
- Create cropping dialog component
- Implement drag-and-drop zone for image uploads
- Add image compression before upload
- Update image preview to show cropped result

#### 2.2 Form Validation Improvements

**Objective**: Enhance form validation and error handling

**Technical Requirements**:

- Add inline validation for all form fields
- Implement real-time field validation
- Add field-specific error display mapping
- Implement phone number pattern validation

**Frontend Changes**:

- Add validation functions for each form field
- Implement real-time validation as users type
- Add proper error display below each field
- Update form submission to handle field-specific errors
- Add phone number validation with Nepali number patterns

#### 2.3 UI/UX Enhancements

**Objective**: Improve overall user experience

**Technical Requirements**:

- Add subtle entrance animations for cards and critical UI elements
- Improve responsive spacing and layout
- Add more whitespace and better typography hierarchy
- Implement proper loading states and skeletons

**Frontend Changes**:

- Add framer-motion for micro-interactions
- Improve responsive design with better breakpoints
- Update typography with better hierarchy
- Add skeleton loaders for initial data loading
- Implement better loading states for all actions

### Phase 3: Accessibility and Performance (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 Accessibility Improvements

**Objective**: Ensure settings page is accessible to all users

**Technical Requirements**:

- Add proper ARIA labels for toggles and interactive elements
- Improve keyboard navigation
- Add focus management for dialogs and modals
- Implement proper error message linking to inputs

**Frontend Changes**:

- Add ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
- Implement keyboard navigation for all components
- Add focus trapping for modals and dialogs
- Link error messages to corresponding inputs
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards

#### 3.2 Performance Optimizations

**Objective**: Improve page load times and responsiveness

**Technical Requirements**:

- Implement data caching with React Query
- Add debouncing for preference toggles
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Implement code splitting for better initial load times

**Frontend Changes**:

- Integrate React Query for API data caching
- Add debouncing to preference update functions
- Implement image lazy loading
- Add code splitting for non-critical components

## Implementation Timeline
