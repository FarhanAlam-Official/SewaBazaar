# Performance and Navigation Analysis Report

## Problematic Areas in the Codebase

### 1. Heavy Component Loading and Rendering Issues

- **Bookings Page Complexity**: The customer bookings page (`page.tsx`) is extremely large (871 lines) with complex transformations and multiple rendering conditions.
- **Redundant Data Transformations**: The code has multiple layers of data transformation happening both in the API services and components.
- **Inefficient Error Handling**: Excessive try-catch blocks with complex error handling logic within components.

### 2. Navigation and Routing Issues

- **Framer Motion Page Transitions**: The `PageTransition` component using Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` is causing layout shifts and delaying navigation.
- **Multiple Router Systems**: ~~Both Next.js router and react-router-dom are included in dependencies, potentially causing conflicts.~~ **RESOLVED**: react-router-dom dependency has been removed.
- **Memory Leaks**: Possible memory leaks from improper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks in navigation components.

### 3. API and Data Fetching Problems

- **Complex Token Refresh Logic**: The authentication system performs multiple API calls during token refresh, which can block navigation.
- **Excessive API Error Handling**: Every API call has complex error handling that may be causing delays.
- **No Request Cancellation**: Missing request cancellation for API calls when components unmount or routes change.

### 4. Component Structure and State Management

- **Large Component Files**: Many components exceed 500 lines of code, making them difficult to optimize.
- **Excessive Re-renders**: No memoization for expensive computations or component renders.
- **Nested State Dependencies**: Complex state dependencies causing cascading re-renders.

### 5. External Libraries and Assets

- **Too Many UI Libraries**: The project uses numerous Radix UI components alongside Framer Motion, increasing bundle size.
- **Spline 3D Components**: `@splinetool` libraries are heavy 3D rendering libraries that significantly impact performance.
- **Redundant Dependencies**: Multiple libraries with overlapping functionality (e.g., `recharts`, `embla-carousel`).

### 6. Code Structure Issues

- **Duplicate Transformation Logic**: The same data transformation code exists in multiple places.
- **Inline Functions in Renders**: Many event handlers are defined inline causing unnecessary re-renders.
- **No Component Code-Splitting**: Large pages aren't using dynamic imports for code splitting.

## Multi-Step Action Plan

### Immediate Fixes (1-2 Days)

1. **Fix Navigation and Routing**:
   - Remove redundant page transitions or optimize the `PageTransition` component by:
     - Reducing animation duration
     - Simplifying animation properties
     - Using `layoutId` for smoother transitions
   - ~~Ensure only one routing system is used (remove `react-router-dom` if using Next.js router)~~ **COMPLETED**: react-router-dom dependency has been removed
   - Add proper cleanup for event listeners and subscriptions

2. **Optimize API Calls**:
   - Implement request cancellation using AbortController for API calls
   - Simplify token refresh logic to reduce blocking operations
   - Add proper error boundaries to prevent cascading failures

3. **Reduce Bundle Size**:
   - Remove or lazy-load heavy libraries like Spline tools
   - Audit and remove unused dependencies
   - Implement code splitting for large component pages

### Short-term Improvements (1 Week)

1. **Component Refactoring**:
   - Break down large components into smaller, focused ones
   - Implement React.memo for pure components
   - Extract and memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
   - Convert inline functions to useCallback

2. **Data Management Optimization**:
   - Implement proper data caching for API responses
   - Consolidate transformation logic into shared utilities
   - Use SWR or React Query for data fetching with caching

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Add performance monitoring tools
   - Implement error tracking
   - Set up user experience monitoring

### Long-term Solutions (2-4 Weeks)

1. **Architecture Improvements**:
   - Implement a state management solution like Redux Toolkit or Zustand
   - Create a robust data fetching layer
   - Establish clear component boundaries and responsibilities

2. **Build and Bundling Optimization**:
   - Configure proper code splitting
   - Optimize image loading with next/image
   - Implement tree shaking for unused code

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Optimize rendering with virtualization for long lists
   - Implement skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
   - Reduce layout shifts with proper content placeholders

## Detailed Technical Recommendations

### 1. Navigation Fix Implementation

```tsx
// Replace the current PageTransition with this optimized version
export function OptimizedPageTransition({ children }: PageTransitionProps) {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  
  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="sync">
      <motion.div
        key={pathname}
        initial={{ opacity: 0.8 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0.8 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.1 }}
      >
        {children}
      </motion.div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  )
}
```

### 2. API Call Optimization

```typescript
// Update API interceptors to include request cancellation
api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  // Cancel previous requests with the same identifier
  const controller = new AbortController();
  config.signal = controller.signal;
  
  // Store the controller to be able to cancel it later
  const requestId = config.url + JSON.stringify(config.params || {});
  if (pendingRequests[requestId]) {
    pendingRequests[requestId].abort();
  }
  pendingRequests[requestId] = controller;
  
  // Add auth token
  const token = Cookies.get("access_token");
  if (token && token.trim()) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  
  return config;
});
```

### 3. Component Optimization

```tsx
// Break down the large bookings component
// Extract BookingCard as a separate component
const BookingCard = memo(({ booking, onCancel }: BookingCardProps) => {
  // Component implementation
});

// Use proper memoization in the parent component
const MemoizedBookingsList = memo(({ bookings, onCancel }) => {
  return (
    <div className="grid gap-4">
      {bookings.map(booking => (
        <BookingCard 
          key={booking.id} 
          booking={booking} 
          onCancel={onCancel} 
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### 4. Lazy Loading Implementation

```tsx
// In page components that use heavy libraries
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Lazy load heavy components
const SplineViewer = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/SplineViewer'),
  { 
    loading: () => <div className="w-full h-[300px] bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-lg" />,
    ssr: false 
  }
)
```

## Progress Tracking
